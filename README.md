# UpSurge Game

**Upsurge** is an arcade game complete with menus and leaderboards so you can compete with your friends! As you get a higher score, you will unlock new skins for your ball. The objective of the game is to jump from rock to rock going higher and higher as the lava floor tries to chase you down. As you complete several subsequent jumps, you will get combo which allows you to jump higher, faster and farther.
